Project Title: Lung Cancer Prediction using Python and ML
Overview:

This project is a web-based application built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive user interfaces. The application provides a comprehensive platform for users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI), submit feedback, visualize data based on their input, and receive predictions using machine learning algorithms. The project aims to provide a user-friendly and interactive experience for users to understand their health metrics and make informed decisions.

Features:
Visualization:
Users can select two entities (x and y axis) from a dropdown menu to visualize the relationship between them.
The visualization is generated using Matplotlib and displays the data in a scatter plot, bar chart, or line graph.
Users can customize the visualization by selecting different colors, markers, and plot types.

BMI Calculator:
Users can input their height and weight to calculate their BMI.
The BMI is then categorized into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on the World Health Organization (WHO) standards.
Users can view their BMI category and the corresponding health risks associated with it.

Feedback Submission:
Users can submit their feedback about the application, which can be used to improve the project.
The feedback form includes fields for users to rate the application, provide comments, and suggest new features.

Prediction:
Users can input their data to receive predictions using machine learning algorithms implemented using Scikit-learn.
The prediction model is trained on a dataset of user inputs and provides predictions based on the user's input features.
Users can view the predicted output and the confidence interval associated with it.



Technical Details:

Frontend:
Streamlit is used to create the user interface, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.
The application is built using Streamlit's API, which allows for easy integration with Python code.


Backend:
Python is used as the backend language, utilizing libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
The application uses a modular design, with separate modules for each feature (BMI calculator, feedback submission, visualization, and prediction).
Machine Learning:
Scikit-learn is used to implement machine learning algorithms for prediction, including:
Label Encoder
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Train Test Lplit
The prediction model is trained on a dataset of user inputs and provides predictions based on the user's input features.
Installation and Usage:

Clone the repository using git clone <repository_url>.
Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application using streamlit run app.py.

Coding Standards:

Python code should follow the PEP 8 style guide.
Code should be well-documented with comments and docstrings.
Code should be tested thoroughly before submission.
